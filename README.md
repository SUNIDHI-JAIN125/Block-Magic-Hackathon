# Ringle: NFT Automated Market Maker (AMM) DeFi Platform

## üëª **Inspiration**
The rapid evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi) has brought significant attention to the potential of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). However, the NFT market faces challenges such as liquidity, price discovery, and providing a seamless trading experience. Inspired by the principles of Automated Market Makers (AMM) and the need to integrate robust financial tools, we set out to create Ringle, a platform that addresses these challenges and enhances the trading experience for NFTs.

## ‚ú® **What it Does**
We have created  liquidity pools for asset pairs (NFTs and other base tokens).

We have used AMM (Automated Market Makers) and Constant Product formula (xy = k ), which makes our platform highly liquid for NFT prices to trade.
     
To engage the beginner traders we have a short and easy game ‚ÄòGUESS AND CLAIM FREE NFT‚Äô, it leverages the service of Chainlink VRF to generate a fully random and fair number. 

Chainlink CCIP makes our platform offer services on other blockchains as well, it     enhances the customer experience  by 2x.

**Providing Liquidity to Asset Pairs:** - In an NFT automated market maker (AMM), providing liquidity to asset pairs can make the trading experience smoother and more reliable. Liquidity providers earn a share of the transaction fees, which encourages more users to provide liquidity. This increased liquidity helps stabilize prices.

**Buying and Selling NFTs** -  You can sell NFTs through ERC-721 and also buy       fractionalised tokens of NFTs through ERC-20 tokens.

**Guessing game with Chainlink VRF** -  If you are a new trader at Ringle and afraid to try it out, why not try and test your luck. Guess the correct number and get a chance to win FREE NFTs. 

## üõ†Ô∏è **How We Built It**
Although it was tough to have a transition from Solana to Ethereum so we have tried using simpler tools but also kept it mind the basic requirements of our platform. 

- **Backend (Smart Contracts):** For writing & deploying Solidity code, we used the Foundry toolkit (i.e. forge) and Remix.

- **Frontend:**  We used SDKs and NextJS to create the UI designs. 

- **Chainlink Integration** -   Chainlink CCIP, Chainlink VRF

- **Blockchain networks** - Sepolia Testnet, Polygon, Scroll

## üìï **Challenges We Ran Into**
- Integrating Smart contracts with the frontend was very trick but eventually we got to learn about new libraries (SDKs)

- Some CCIP functions were confusing for us initially. We had to thoroughly understand the documentation and make relevant changes. 

## üé° **Accomplishments That We're Proud Of**
